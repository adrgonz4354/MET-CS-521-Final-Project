Symptom Checker By Adrian Gonzalez
MET CS-521 Information Structures With Python

READ ME:

	Make sure that the datetime module and os module works on your version of Python
	To run the code, click on the "Final_Python_Project.py" file. 
	
	If you want to check your symptoms do $start and answer with y or n answers. 

	If you want to check your discharge files, click on the discharge_files folder and find the .txt file. The 
	program should tell you where to find it as well.

	DO NOT DELETE the "Discharge_Files" folder, otherwise an error will occur (it won't terminate the program
	but there won't be output files)
